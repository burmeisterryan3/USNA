Task 1: shredder
For this task, I had to call the alarm signal in the parent while
waiting on the child.  I then executed in the child and allowed the
parent to continue sending alarm signals to itself until the child had
finished.  Once the child had finished, I printed a different
statement depending on how long the process took to run.  If the
process took more than five ticks, I called the child and printed a
different message.


Task 2: moresons

For this task, I had to ensure that I first set up the sigaction
signal handler correctly.  The flags had to be set to ensure that the
signal handler could receive signals within itself, ensure that
certain signal calls could restart if necessary, and ensure that the
handler had three arguments to which I could refer to when attempting
to handle the signal.  I then had to check the si_code for each of the
different scenarios in which the child could have been sent a signal.
Within each of these test structures, I had to loop over the c_pid
array and search for the pid that matched the current child pid to
print the correct index for the child.
