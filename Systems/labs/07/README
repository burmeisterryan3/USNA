Task 1: littleman

 A. Describe what happened when the fork bomb reached its conclusion?
 What system resources ran out?
When the fork bomb reached its conclusion, my computer seemed to be in
 a frozen state.  I could not move my mouse or type in any commands.
 I could still switch between different ttys, but I could not login.
 This was due to the lack of memory available as the fork bomb was
 using it all.
 
 B. What must you do to reset your computer? 
 I had to hardboot my computer to reset it.

Task 2: bigboy

  A. Fill out the following information in the table below. The first
   two rows(n=0 and n=4) have been done for you as examples:

  Column A: Number of generations to pass to forkbomb (e.g. formbomb2 4)
  Column B: Number of forkbomb2 processes running (use ps -C forkbomb2)
  Column C: Total number of processes as reported by 'top'
  Column D: CPU usage as reported by 'top'
  Column E: Free Memory as reported by 'top'

A        B        C        D            E
-------------------------------------------------------
0        1       205    12.5%     5783960K
4       16       222   100.0%     5783469K   
5       32       245   100.0%     6619216K
10      1024    1237   100.0%     6526876K
13      8292    8405    99.7%     5795332K      
14      6454    10043   99.7%     5640336K
15      9830    10043   99.5%     5658172K
16      9828    10041   99.6%     5541388K

 B. What was the lowest value of n in the table above that failed to
 start the expected number of bigboy processes?

bigboy 14 was the lowest value of n that failed to start the expected
 number of bigboy processes.

 C. How many bigboy processes should have been created for the row in
 1b? How many were actually created? How does this related to the
 ulimit?

There should have been 2^n processes created for each number entered
 after bigboy.  Once I reached 14, the process limit was limited to
 approximately 10K processes.

Task 3: myps

  For myps, I had to format the string to ensure that fopen could open
  the correct process path.  Once I had the correct format for the
  string, I was able to open the file path and pullthe necessary
  information.  I then printed the necessary variables in the correct
  format and informed the user if the pid was invalid.
