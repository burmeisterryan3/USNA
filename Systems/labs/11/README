Task 1: myhost
For this task, the first thing I had to do was set up the hints.  To
do this I zeroed them out with memset initially before setting
ai_family to AF_INET so that I only received IPv4 addresses.  I also
had to set a hint to ensure that I only received TCP connections.  To
do this I set ai_protocol to IPROTO_TCP.  I then set my getaddrinfo
struct and check for any errors.  The last portion for this step
involved running through a linked list and printing out the IP address
for the particular domain name given.

Task 2: mywget
The beginning of this task was similar to the beginnign of myhost.  I
had to ensure that my structs were set up correctly to establish a
connection between two sockets.  Once the sockets were connected, I
sent a GET request and opened a file with the basename of the filepath
on the server.  I then read from the socket and wrote the information
that was passed over the network to the file with the specified basename.
