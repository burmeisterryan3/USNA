Task 1: factor
For this task, I had to create four different threads that each shared
the workload to factor a large product of two prime numbers.  To
complete this task, I divided the numbers to check into four equal
groups and then allowed each to run "simultaneously" on the CPU.  This
allowed for quicker execution time for a time that could take nearly
twice as long for single-threaded processor.

Task 2: threaded-server
For this task, I had the main thread accept connections from clients.
Once a connection had been established, a thread would take over for
the connection and allow for interaction after the initial
connection.  The thread would read input, and then send it back to
confirm that the message had been sent.  When the client closed, the
thread recognized this and closed the socket and variables appropriately.
