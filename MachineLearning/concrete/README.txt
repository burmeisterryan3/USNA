with negative lambda... something that encourages big weights, the error shoots up to massive amounts

then when it gets to a big positive lambda, the error starts to shoot up as well


Do we not see parab. b/c the scale of our graph?
  We are too zoomed in on the scale of lambda (0-1)... vs (-15 - 200)
