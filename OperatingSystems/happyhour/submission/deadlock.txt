How we know deadlock occurred:
First, it is easy to note that the program has not completed
as the final line to be printed is "All islanders have achieved
happyhour."  However, as this did not occur and the program
reached a point at which no work was being done, the program
is known to have reached a deadlocked state.

Why deadlock occurred:
It is first important to note that we have 50 islanders who are
trying to access three resources at the same time.  We know they
are accessing resources at the same time through the creation of
threads.
Deadlock becomes troublesome as each islander is trying to access 
each of the three resources.  Each islander will access these 
resources in one of three orders where the selection of the order 
is random.  However, the islanders do not drop any of the objects
until they have obtained all three and made their pina colada.  
This is a problem as there are only 3 machetes and 6 funnels 
available for making their drinks.  We can think of a scenario in
which 6 islanders grab a machete and simultaneously 3 islanders 
grab a funnel.  None of the islanders will be able to make their 
pina colada as they are waiting on one of the other islanders to 
drop the necessary resource. 
Coconuts will never be competed for as their is an equal number of
coconuts and islanders.  One may have to wait for a coconut due to
the order in which objects are selected is preset and an islander
may wait for a machete before picking their coconut.
