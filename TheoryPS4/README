The program starts by reading in input from the desired
text file, and assigning the value to an appropriate
variable that I have created.  Once everything has been
read in from the specified file, the tape is read in.
The tape in my program is a vector, and I continually
add to the back of the vector until there is nothing more
to add.  The next stage of the program is running the
turing machine.  The turning machine must find the
appropriate delta function and apply the transition
accordingly.  This was done in the structure of two for
loops and the use of a boolean value.  The boolean value
was used to determine whether the appropriate delta
function had in fact been used.  The head was decremented
or incremented depending on whether the transition was
to the left or right on the tape.  If at any point the
machine reached the accept state or no transition function,
the running ended and the input was either accepted or
rejected.
