Furthest completed step- 6

I completed all of the bullets for step 6 including:

*Implement castling
*Disallow diagonal movement for pawns unless capturing. 
          Also, disallow capturing through forward movement.
*Implement en passant
*Implement pawn promotion (you may assume it is promoted to a queen)
*Force the King to move if in check
*Disallow the King moving into check.

I created a static reference back to the board in the Piece class
which allowed for separate child classes of Piece to reference
this static variable.  This allowed me to check for special case moves
(above) while remaining without having to check for specific moves
within the board class.  This allowed the king, for instance, to completely
control all moves directly related to a king object.  Without this
reference, I would have had to check within the board's makeMove method.

Steps 1-5, are all implented within each of Piece's child classes.
